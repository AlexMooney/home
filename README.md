# Home Directory Files

This repository contains several files from my home directory to enable syncing
quickly across devices and customizing new machines with my preferred settings.
Hidden files and directories in the home directory have the `.` removed here.
`install.sh` copies all files from this repository to the home directory and
creates hard links so that version control for all files can occur in this 
repository.
